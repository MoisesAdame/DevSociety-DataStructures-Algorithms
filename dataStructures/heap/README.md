# Heap
A *Heap* is a special type of data structure that is used to store and manage a collection of items, where each item has a *priority or ranking*. The Heap data structure is designed to allow for efficient insertion, deletion, and retrieval of items, while maintaining the priority of each item. Heaps are particularly useful in situations where items need to be sorted or prioritized, such as in scheduling, resource allocation, or decision-making.
